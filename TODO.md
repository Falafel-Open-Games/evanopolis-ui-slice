## Tile Flip Rules (Not Implemented)

- Start tile flip on pass-over to begin a new cycle (Start ↔ Fiat Inflation).
- Bear tile flip on pass-over to change the effect for the next landing (Bear ↔ Bull).


## Inspection Rules

- Inspection blocks mining payouts from the player's properties until cleared.

## UI announcements log
- keep a log of all game event messages, like:
    - turn {turn, cycle, player} start, 
    - pawn moved to {tile},
    - mining rewards from {tile, miners count, payout value} collected by {player},
    - energy toll payed {from player, to player, value, tile}

## Review game economics

- players should be able to profit more from energy tolls
- miners should be easier to construct, but limit to the number of cards in the same city
- players should be able to sell properties?

## UI Cleanup

- Remove dual-currency payment options (fiat/bitcoin) from the game UI.
