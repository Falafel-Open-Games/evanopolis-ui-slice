### Playtesters

- Juliana: the course length feels too long; concerns sessions could exceed Monopoly-length games.
- Coinmax: if using a bitcoin miner 3D model for property constructions, prefer a hydro type with hoses. If using a shipping container, make it open on the side with four slots visible.

### Internal

- Disable the End Turn button while Roll Dices is enabled and unused.
- The right sidebar layout breaks when landing on a special property.
- Left sidebar should allow only one expanded panel at a time; collapse others on manual change.
- Left sidebar could include UI for actions that do not need to happen on a player's turn (constructing, "hipotecar", or checking other players' properties).
